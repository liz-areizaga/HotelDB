# Hotel Management System

System that manages hotel bookings and managerial functionalities.

To compile the code, you must start and create the PostgreDB using the executable .sh files in the lab5 folder within our project zip folder. Other files unrelated to the start, create and stop PostgreDB within the lab5 folder can be ignored. After doing so compilation is as normal.
